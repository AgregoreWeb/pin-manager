<details>
  <summary>How does this work?</summary>
  <p>
    The Pin Manager lets you talk to multiple "IPFS Pinning Services at a time.
    These services exist as remote backups for your data.
    Currently we support the <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/">IPFS Pinning Service API Specification</a> and the <a href="https://ipfscluster.io/">IPFS Cluster API Specification</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When configuring an IPFS pinning service, place the <code>Authentication Token</code> into the password section of the URL.
    For example, this could look like <a href="">https://:YourTokenHere@example.com/</a>.
    Some services like IPFS cluster use "Basic Authentication" which means you will need to supply both a username and password.
    Make sure you're putting your services behind an HTTPs gateway so that you don't expose your credentials to the network!
  </P
  <p>
    If you are running a service and would like to quickly onboard new users into it, you can click the "link" in the service information and send it to somebody.
    This link will contain a special "invite" parameter which will automatically configure pin-manager to use the service info when a person visits it.
    Note that these links are not revokable, so make sure you only share them via trusted channels!
